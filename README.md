# 🏠 Army Management System 📚

## 🌟 Introduction

The Army Management System is a database-driven solution developed to streamline military operations including personnel tracking, unit assignments, mission planning, training coordination, and inventory management. This system was created as part of the Capstone Project for the Software Engineering program at Adventist University of Central Africa.

Its core objective is to replace manual data handling with a secure, centralized platform that ensures data consistency, operational transparency, and improved administrative efficiency across different army departments.

## 	📝 Overview

The Army Management System is a database-driven project designed to manage soldier registration, unit assignments, training schedules, mission planning, and inventory tracking. It was developed in partial fulfillment of the Capstone Project for the Software Engineering program at AUCA.

# 📍 Entities and Relationships

**The system contains the following major entities:**

**💡 Users**- Administrative users managing the system.

**💡 Soldiers**- Personnel enlisted in the military.

**💡 Units**- Operational groups soldiers are assigned to.

**💡 Trainning**- Tracks trainning sessions per soldier.

**💡 Missions**- Deployment operations soldiers take part in.

**💡 Inventory**- Items issued to units.

**💡 Soldier_missions**- A junction table for the many to many relationship between soldiers and missions.



## 🚀 PHASE 1 — Database Design and Problem Analysis

**Problem:**  Disconnected, manual management of soldiers, missions, training records, and inventory within a military institution.

**Context:** Applied to a centralized Army Command for digital transformation.

**Users:** Military administrators, commanders, and system officers.

**Goals:** Automate personnel tracking, mission assignments, inventory visibility, and ensure data consistency.

## 🛠 Problem Definition

"Military organizations often rely on disconnected paper-based systems to manage soldiers, units, training, missions, and inventory. This lack of integration leads to delays, errors, and inefficiencies in command operations."

Without a centralized digital system, military administration faces:

🧭 Disorganized soldier and unit records

📂 Limited mission tracking and accountability

📉 Inventory mismanagement and resource duplication

🔐 Minimal access control and security auditing



### 📍 Context

🪖 Military bases handle thousands of soldiers across multiple units.

📜 Operations depend on accurate records and timely deployment.

📊 Manual tracking is prone to error and cannot scale.

💻 There's a growing need for digitized and secure army databases.

### 👥 Target Users

🧑‍✈️ Commanders / Officers – To assign and monitor soldier activities

🧑‍💼 Admins – To register users and maintain system access

🧑‍🎓 Developers (You) – To build, test, and document the database system

### 🎯 Project Goals

      🧩 Digitize and centralize military personnel records

      🎯 Enable mission and training tracking per soldier

      🛠 Improve inventory visibility by unit

     🔐 Enforce user roles and secure access control

     📈 Support reporting and auditing of operations
