# 📍 Entities and Relationships

**The system contains the following major entities:**

**💡 Users**- Administrative users managing the system.

**💡 Soldiers**- Personnel enlisted in the military.

**💡 Units**- Operational groups soldiers are assigned to.

**💡 Trainning**- Tracks trainning sessions per soldier.

**💡 Missions**- Deployment operations soldiers take part in.

**💡 Inventory**- Items issued to units.

**💡 Soldier_missions**- A junction table for the many to many relationship between soldiers and missions.



## 🚀 PHASE 1 — Database Design and Problem Analysis

**Problem:**  Disconnected, manual management of soldiers, missions, training records, and inventory within a military institution.

**Context:** Applied to a centralized Army Command for digital transformation.

**Users:** Military administrators, commanders, and system officers.

**Goals:** Automate personnel tracking, mission assignments, inventory visibility, and ensure data consistency.

## 🛠 Problem Definition

"Military organizations often rely on disconnected paper-based systems to manage soldiers, units, training, missions, and inventory. This lack of integration leads to delays, errors, and inefficiencies in command operations."

Without a centralized digital system, military administration faces:

🧭 Disorganized soldier and unit records

📂 Limited mission tracking and accountability

📉 Inventory mismanagement and resource duplication

🔐 Minimal access control and security auditing



## 📍 Context

🪖 Military bases handle thousands of soldiers across multiple units.

📜 Operations depend on accurate records and timely deployment.

📊 Manual tracking is prone to error and cannot scale.

💻 There's a growing need for digitized and secure army databases.



## 👥 Target Users

🧑‍✈️ Commanders / Officers – To assign and monitor soldier activities

🧑‍💼 Admins – To register users and maintain system access

🧑‍🎓 Developers (You) – To build, test, and document the database system



## 🎯 Project Goals

🧩 Digitize and centralize military personnel records

🎯 Enable mission and training tracking per soldier

🛠 Improve inventory visibility by unit

 🔐 Enforce user roles and secure access control

 📈 Support reporting and auditing of operations



 # 🔄 Phase II: Business Process Modeling (MIS)

 **Objective:** Visualize the flow of military operations (such as soldier registration, mission assignment, and inventory management) using BPMN to clarify roles, interactions, and decision points.
 
## 📍 What This Phase Covers

This phase focuses on visualizing how key military departments — such as Personnel, Operations, and Logistics — interact with the system. Using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), the workflow illustrates how
data flows from one user role to another and where decisions are made. This aligns with MIS principles by improving transparency, command coordination, and system accountability.

🔍 Diagram Explanation

➤ Process Flow Overview:

The process starts with soldier registration and continues through:

   Assign to Unit

   Equipment Assignment & Logging

   Check Equipment Availability

   Plan Deployment

   Conduct Training

   Execute Mission
   

↩ Arrows branching and looping reflect repeatable or conditional activities like checking equipment status before mission deployment.


## ➤ Key Interactions:

   Personnel ↔ Equipment: Once a soldier is assigned, equipment is issued.

   Equipment ↔ Deployment: Only available equipment allows mission planning to proceed.

   Training ↔ Mission Execution: Training is required before final deployment.

## ➤ Decision Points:

   ✅ Equipment Check: Is gear available before planning?

   🔁 Loop: If not, training and logs are revisited or restarted.


## 🧩 MIS Alignment

   📊 Decision Support: Clear visibility into soldier readiness and equipment status.

   🔄 Operational Streamlining: Minimizes manual checks.

   📥 Data Capture: Each step updates logs used for command reporting.



  ###  📂 Phase III: Logical Model Design (ER Diagram)

# 💾 Phase IV: Database (Pluggable Database) Creation and Naming

## 📍 What This Phase Covers:

## 🧱 1. Database Creation (Container Setup)

**Before creating a pluggable database, we start by connecting as SYSDBA to the CDB root container and check existing containers.**

```sql

sqlplus / as sysdba

```

**Check existing pluggable databases**

```sql

SHOW PDBS;
```

**Result:**

```sql

    CON_ID CON_NAME                       OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
---------- ------------------------------ ---------- ----------
         2 PDB$SEED                       READ ONLY  NO
         3 ORCLPDB                        MOUNTED

```

**✅ You can confirm you're working inside CDB$ROOT using:**

```sql

SHOW CON_NAME;

```

## 📸 Screenshot Requirement showing pdb:



## 📊 Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) Configuration

After setting up the database, we opened Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) to monitor and manage our PDB.
